# Movie Analysis

Understanding the success of movies through data analytics

## Overview and Business Problem

Microsoft is looking to enter the film making space and their next venture is to launch a movie studio. As part of their plans to break into the industry, Microsoft needs to conduct an initial data analysis of current competitors to determine the types of movies they should produce. Popular movies in recent years can be linked to certain genres and persons. Microsoft can leverage this type of data analysis as time goes by to gain an understanding of the public's current preferences to operate their movie-making business.

### The Data

The IMDB website contains detailed information about all movies that have been released, such as genre, year, rating, cast, production, and more. Additionally, Box Office Mojo summarizes financial data for each movie to show performance through metrics such as gross domestic proceeds.

### Methods
This project looks at studio that has yeilded the most in gross domestic proceeds up to date to identify which company is leading the space. From there, Microsoft can narrow their focus to study the type of movies the leading studio produces and follow its best practices. This project also looks at popular genre combinations and associated persons to provide some initial direction when it comes to creative ideas behind Microsoft's first movie.

### Results
