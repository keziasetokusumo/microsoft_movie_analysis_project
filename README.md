# Movie Analysis

Understanding the success of movies through data analytics

## Overview and Business Problem

Microsoft is looking to enter the film making space and their next venture is to launch a movie studio. As part of their plans to break into the industry, Microsoft needs to conduct an initial data analysis of current competitors to determine the types of movies they should produce. Initial analysis and data output show that most of the domestic market share is dominated by Buena Vista studios. Additionally, popular movies in recent years can be linked to certain genres and associated persons. Microsoft can leverage this type of data analysis as time goes by to gain an understanding of the public's current preferences and popular figures to launch their movie-making business.

### The Data

The IMDB website contains detailed information about all movies that have been released, such as genre, year, rating, cast, production, and more. Additionally, Box Office Mojo summarizes financial data for each movie to show performance through metrics such as gross domestic proceeds.
