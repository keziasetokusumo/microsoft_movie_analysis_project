## Overview and Business Problem

Microsoft is looking to enter the film making space and their next venture is to launch a movie studio. As part of their plans to break into the industry, Microsoft needs to conduct an initial data analysis of current competitors to determine the types of movies they should produce. Popular movies in recent years can be linked to certain genres and persons. Microsoft can leverage this type of data analysis as time goes by to gain an understanding of the public's current preferences to operate their movie-making business.

### The Data

The IMDB website contains detailed information about all movies that have been released, such as genre, year, rating, cast, production, and more. Additionally, Box Office Mojo summarizes financial data for each movie to show performance through metrics such as gross domestic proceeds.

### Methods
This project begins by analyzing basic facts about the movie, such as the typical run time in this case. The analysis then pivots to determine which studio has yeilded the most in total gross proceeds up to date - the purpose behind this is to understand which company is currently leading the space. From there, Microsoft can narrow their focus to study the type of movies genres that the leading studio produces most often. Lastly, this project identifies popular persons to provide Microsoft with an initial direction of who to involve in their projects.

### Results

Most movies have a duration near 100 minutes, with the average run time at ~86 minutes.

### Conclusions / Recommendations
* Microsoft should keep their movie run times consistent with or near the industry average, ideally between 80-100 minutes
* Microsoft can leverage BV Studio's best practices, especially focusing on developing successful movies in action and adventure
* When people think of movies, they often only remember famous cast members, however, selecting the crew behind the camera is just as important - Microsoft can start by considering individuals such as Brian Baucum, Paul Greive, and Lindsay Thompson, among others

### Data Considerations and Limitations
* Look at the available budget and compare it to gross proceeds, as some companies have more resources than others
* Conduct data analysis of which type of movies have been popular during different years, as public preferences often change
* Much of a movie's success is also due to how well it's remembered - future data analysis can also look at how long a movie was being showed since release or how many replays a movie received on streaming platforms like Netflix/Hulu
